# HTML5-Geolocation-API-Demo

In this digital era, we all are surrounded by smartphones with which most of our daily tasks get done easily. And especially for location-challenged people, the geolocation feature is the most useful addition, and it should be integrated in all web and mobile apps.

And here, Iâ€™ve created the same demo on [Integrating HTML5 Geolocation API to Obtain Visitor Location in PHP](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/html5-geolocation-api-current-location-php/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your website and looking to [Hire PHP developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-php-developer/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
